## This is a Captain Of Industry Mod 

It adds terrain and loos products to be able to dump/mine walls.

This mod is based on/compatible with Captain Of Industry Update3

It is very much WIP. 

It is all functional but there are no icons yet, so you will see COI default ones.

All products and the machine are included without research.

There is a machine "Wallmixer II" with a recipe to create "Wall Loose Product"
Wall Loose product can be used as any other dumpable product.
